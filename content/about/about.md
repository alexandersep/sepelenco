Hi, I'm studying **Integrated Computer Science** in Trinity College Dublin.
I'm a 3rd year with plans of pursuing the Master's programme.

I am currently seeking internships for next year of 4th year 
starting in January and ending before September of 2024 
(roughly a 5-8 month internship), as a part of my Master's programme.
