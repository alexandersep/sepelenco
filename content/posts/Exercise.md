Throughout my childhood I have done many sports, football, rugby, judo,
Taekwando, Swimming. Out of all these sports, I stuck with swimming. 
I began swimming at a very young age, and in a club at 14 or so. However
I stopped before my Leaving Certificate, at around 17 years old. I didn't
like Swimming, the 5 hours a week, with 2 of the hours not even swimming, 
but simply exercising on land. It was rather painful, but I am happy I went
through it. Waking up at 7 am on weekends and eating a hearty breakfast 
is a good start to the day. Coming home from an early exercise felt like
a whole day has yet to happen, and that was truly the case. Swimming helped
my sleep schedule, health, and mental mind.

## Now What?
So... What's my next plan on getting physically in shape. I have 2. Last week
I went to the gym in Trinity. I haven't ever been to this gym before so it was
new experience. I went to the gym during summer when I was young, but haven't
been in one since forever, a friend who was been going for over a year, showed
me the ropes. So I plan to go gym with him, and also do one other sport which
I've gotten a lot of interest recently.

### Bouldering
Bouldering is something that has intrigued me since first year of University.
I much prefer it to climbing (with rope) as it gives me more time climbing and
challenging myself and allowing myself to fall. I love putting in my all, and I
find that rope climbing prevents me from using my full ability. Two days ago, I
went bouldering with my good friend. I spent 3 hours at that session. By the end
of it I was exhausted, feet were bruised and starving for food. Bouldering took
a lot of out me, but it gave me a glimpse on what I can achieve. I plan on going
bouldering once a week and documenting my progress in the upcoming future. 
Documenting progress is another way of keeping up with the habit.
